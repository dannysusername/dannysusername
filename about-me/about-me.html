    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> 
      I was born and raised in Miami Florida to <strong>first and second</strong> generation immigrant parents.
      My dad was born in Cuba and when he was a few years old his cousins picked him up on a boat along with his parents en route 
      to the shores of Miami.My mom was born in Miami just a year after her parents came when they were 20 years old. Both of my 
      parents families fled Cuba after Fidel Castro a dictator took power and implemented <strong><em>harsh</em> communist policy to 
      the whole island</strong>. My mom became a medical Pathologist and my dad owns a Air-Taxi business. My mom and dad gave me a <em>great</em>
      childhood and provided a great parental mix for me growing up. If i was sick or injured I would run to my mother who is a expert
      in medicine. If i wanted to know any general idea about the world I would ask my dad.

    <h2><b><abbr title = "Frequently asked Questions"> FAQ </abbr></b></h2>
    <p>Why did you decide to pursue programming/computer science?</p>
    <p>
    My dad introduced me to the field of programming since I was young. I originally wasn't interested but in college I realized I gain satisfaction from doing it and 
    think its exciting to be part of the tech industry.

    <p>What are your plans for the future?</p>
    <p>
    I want to build products/services or something that is inspiring, exciting and helps the world in some sort of way. I plan to learn as much programming as possible, meet people 
    then some day create my own company
